# Recursion

This folder mainly has solutions to below listed practice questions from a book.

NOTE: RF means Recursive Function.

### Questions
1. RF to input and add n numbers. ([solution](./solutions/q1.c))
2. RF to enter a line of text and display it in reverse order without storing the text in an array. ([solution](./solutions/q2.c))
3. RF to count all prime numbers between two positive integers `a` and `b` (inclusive). ([solution](./solutions/q3.c))
4. RF to display all _proper divisors_ of a number and display their sum. ([solution](./solutions/q4.c))
   A proper divisor of `n` is a positive divisor of `n` and is not equal to `n`.
5. RF to check whether a number is perfect or not.
6. RF to find sum of all even numbers in an array.
7. RF to find sum of all elements in an array by repeatedly dividing it into two almost equal parts.
8. RF to reverse the elements of an array.
9. RF to check whether an array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
10. RF to display positive integers in words. Example: 1234 is displayed as `one two three four`
11. RF to reverse an non-negative integer.
