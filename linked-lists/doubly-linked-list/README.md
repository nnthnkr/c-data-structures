# Doubly Linked List

The code is almost identical to that of a singly linked list. Only major difference is that now we have the convenience
a prev pointer and so can perform traversal, search, delete and other operations from both ends. 

## problems to solve
```text
- Write a C function to define the structure for a doubly linked list node and initialize an empty list.
- Implement a function to insert a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- Write a program to insert a node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- Implement insertion of a node at a specified position in a doubly linked list.
- Implement deletion of the first node in a doubly linked list.
- Write code to delete the last node in a doubly linked list.
- Implement deletion of a node from a specific position in a doubly linked list.
- Implement a function to display the elements of the doubly linked list from head to tail.
- Write a routine to traverse and display the list from tail to head.
- Implement a function to search for a specific value in the doubly linked list and return its position.
- Write a program to update the data contained in a given node of a doubly linked list.
- Implement an algorithm to reverse a doubly linked list in-place.
- Merge two sorted doubly linked lists into one sorted list.
- Write code to count the total number of nodes in a doubly linked list.
- Implement the removal of all duplicate elements from a doubly linked list.
- Write a C function to split a doubly linked list into two lists at a specified position.
