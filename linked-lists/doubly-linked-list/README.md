# Doubly Linked List

The code is almost identical to that of a singly linked list. Only major difference is that now we have the convenience
a prev pointer and so can perform traversal, search, delete and other operations from both ends. 

## Problems to solve
```text
- [x] Write a C function to define the structure for a doubly linked list node and initialize an empty list.
- [x] Implement a function to insert a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- [x] Write a program to insert a node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- [x] Implement insertion of a node at a specified position in a doubly linked list.
- [x] Implement deletion of the first node in a doubly linked list.
- [x] Write code to delete the last node in a doubly linked list.
- [x] Implement deletion of a node from a specific position in a doubly linked list.
- [x] Implement a function to display the elements of the doubly linked list from head to tail.
- [x] Write a routine to traverse and display the list from tail to head.
- [x] Implement a function to search for a specific value in the doubly linked list and return its position.
- [x] Write a program to update the data contained in a given node of a doubly linked list.
- [x] Implement an algorithm to reverse a doubly linked list in-place.
